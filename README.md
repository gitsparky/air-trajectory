# Air trajectory app

This repo contains attempts to build a toy app to help with NY Science Olympiad Air trajectory project. This is also my excuse to try out the 'vibe coding' hype on a simple app.

There are attempts to use a plain JS app (that is runnable in a browser) as well as
an app in Python, since at some point Gemini said one of the JS calc was not stable. Regardless, not all variants of the apps work.

*WARNING*: The equations look reasonable but have not been thoroughly verified, so use at your own risk!
